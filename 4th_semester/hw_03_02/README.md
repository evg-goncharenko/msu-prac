<b> [vector](./vector.c): </b><br>
    
The program simulates the implementation of vectors:
1) Initialization: `Vector v1(10, 2), v2(v1), v3(10);`
2) Assignment-operator: `v3 = v2 = v1; v2 = v1;`
3) Constant vector
4) `push_back()` and `pop_back()` operations
5) Initialization with constant values: `Vector v = {1, 4, 2, 2};`
